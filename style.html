<h2>Principles of Accounting</h2>

	<p>This class is the second part of Principles of Accounting- a required course for all Pamplin majors. We focused on managerial accounting for the duration of the class and it was very different than the first section of accounting. The concepts learned in this class are applied in many aspects of the business world. I have already seen these concepts come up in multiple classes, including economics, business information technology, and management. Some of the most important concepts learned were cost accounting, break-even points, and net present value.  </p>

<h3>The British Novel</h3>
		<p>The British Novel is a fun class where we go through the novel's beginnings in Europe up until modern times. We begun with one of the first novels ever written- <i>The History of Tom Jones a Foundling.</i> The final book and most recent novel we read was <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.</i>The book is not only the most modern in time, but it also showcases the development of the novel throughout the centuries.Not only did we go through each substantial movement of literature from the sixteenth century up unto a few years ago, but we also learned much about the history and culture surrounding the novels. Learning the historical context for the novels was my favorite part of the course and I feel as though I now know much more about the English culture than I did before taking this course.  </p>

<h3>British Literary History</h3>
		<p>This course is a requirement for all English majors. We learn about literature in Britain from medieval times to almost modern times. We go over major literary works and authors including, <i>Beowolf,</i><i>Paradise Lost,</i>Virginia Woolf, and Charles Dickens. Despite this being a history course, we focused more so on the literary interpretations of the different works. It was interesting seeing how the culture developed over many centuries and what were considered important topics to write about. </p>
